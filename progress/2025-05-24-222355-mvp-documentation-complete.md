## 🎮 What Users Can Now Do

1. **Load application** in any modern browser without installation
2. **Take guided tour** to learn the complete interface
3. **Select base profile** from MK4 series (Quality/Speed/Draft)
4. **Create custom cards** with guided CardBuilder interface
5. **Browse card library** with search, filter, and category organization
6. **Build profiles** by dragging and reordering cards with conflict detection
7. **Preview changes** with real-time before/after comparisons
8. **Export to INI** for direct import into PrusaSlicer
9. **Share projects** via URL encoding for collaboration
10. **Use on mobile** with full touch and responsive support

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Real PrusaSlicer Integration (Phase 6.5)
- Profile data collection from official Prusa repositories
- INI parser development for real PrusaSlicer format
- Profile integration replacing demo profiles with real ones
- End-to-end validation with actual PrusaSlicer compatibility

### Implementation Ready
- Framework already implemented for profile integration
- INI export system designed for PrusaSlicer compatibility  
- Card system architecture supports real profile structures
- All tools and infrastructure in place for data integration
