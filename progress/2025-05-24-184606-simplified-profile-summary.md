# Profile Summary Simplification - 2025-05-24 18:46:06

## Milestone Achieved
✅ **Simplified Profile Summary Interface**: Replaced expandable categories with a simple, scannable list format matching the Key Settings design pattern.

## Changes Summary
Refactored the Profile Summary component to improve user experience by removing complex UI interactions and creating a more streamlined view of setting changes.

## Files Modified

### `src/features/ui/components/ProfileSummary.tsx`
- **Removed expandable functionality**: Eliminated toggle buttons, expanded/collapsed states, and section grouping
- **Simplified data structure**: Changed from grouped changes to flat array with `getAllChanges()` function
- **Unified list format**: Made "All Changes" section consistent with "Key Settings" layout
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused Button, ChevronDown, ChevronRight, Eye, EyeOff components
- **Preserved visual indicators**: Kept conflict (orange triangle) and success (green checkmark) icons
- **Fixed accessibility**: Wrapped icons in divs with proper title attributes

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Simplified Change Display
- **Flat list format**: All setting changes displayed in a single, scannable list
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the existing "Key Settings" section design
- **Label + value layout**: Setting name on left, new value on right
- **Visual status indicators**: Clear icons showing success or conflict state

### 2. Improved Scannability
- **No interaction required**: Users can immediately see all changes without expanding sections
- **Consistent information density**: Uniform spacing and typography throughout
- **Quick visual scanning**: Icons and layout make status immediately apparent

### 3. Maintained Functionality
