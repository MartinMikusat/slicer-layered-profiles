# Fuzzy Skin Profile Summary Debugging Attempt

**Date**: 2025-05-24 23:57:28  
**Status**: Partial Progress - Issue Remains Unresolved  
**Type**: Bug Investigation & Attempted Fix

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: The Fuzzy Skin layer is enabled but its parameters don't appear in the Profile Summary panel, while all other layers work correctly.

**Impact**: Users cannot see what changes the Fuzzy Skin layer makes, reducing transparency and usability of the layer system.

## Investigation & Attempted Fixes

### Initial Hypothesis
The `updateLayerPreviews()` function was unconditionally regenerating previews for all layers, potentially overwriting the manually crafted preview in the fuzzy skin layer from `defaultLayers.ts`.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Fuzzy Skin Defaults to Base Profiles
**File**: `src/features/profiles/baseProfiles.ts`
- Added missing fuzzy skin settings to all three base profiles:
  - `fuzzy_skin: 'none'`
  - `fuzzy_skin_thickness: 0.3`
  - `fuzzy_skin_point_dist: 0.8`
  - `external_perimeter_speed: 25`
- **Rationale**: Ensure preview generation has proper baseline values to compare against

#### 2. Modified Preview Preservation Logic
**File**: `src/features/profiles/profileCompiler.ts`
- Updated `updateLayerPreviews()` function to preserve existing previews when they match the layer's patches
- Added logic to check if existing preview covers all patch paths before regenerating
- **Rationale**: Allow layers from `defaultLayers.ts` to maintain their carefully crafted previews

#### 3. Debug Logging (Added/Removed)
**File**: `src/features/ui/components/ProfileSummary.tsx`
- Added temporary debug logging to trace fuzzy skin layer processing
- Removed debug logging after investigation
- **Rationale**: Attempt to identify where in the data flow the preview data is lost

## Results

**❌ Issue Not Resolved**: Despite the logical fixes, the fuzzy skin layer parameters still do not appear in the Profile Summary.

**✅ Other Layers Still Work**: All other demo layers continue to function correctly, showing their changes in the Profile Summary as expected.

## Current Status

### What Works
- Other demo layers (Faster Perimeters, Higher Temperature, Aggressive Cooling, Dense Infill) show changes correctly
- Base profile values display properly
- Layer ordering and toggling functionality works
- Profile compilation succeeds without errors

### What Doesn't Work
- Fuzzy Skin layer changes are not visible in Profile Summary
- Expected changes should be:
  1. Fuzzy Skin: none → outside
  2. Fuzzy Skin Thickness: 0.3mm → 0.4mm
  3. Fuzzy Skin Point Distance: 0.8mm → 0.8mm
  4. External Perimeter Speed: 25mm/s → 30mm/s

## Next Investigation Steps

1. **Add Detailed Debug Logging**: Trace the exact data flow for the fuzzy skin layer through:
   - Layer loading in `App.tsx` 
   - Preview generation in `profileCompiler.ts`
   - Display logic in `ProfileSummary.tsx`

2. **Verify Layer Structure**: Compare the fuzzy skin layer structure with working layers to identify differences

3. **Test Simplified Version**: Create a minimal fuzzy skin layer to isolate whether the issue is with the layer definition or the processing logic

4. **Check Compilation Pipeline**: Verify the layer is being properly included in `compiledProfile.appliedLayers`

5. **Examine Preview Data**: Confirm the preview array contains the expected 4 changes

## Technical Notes

- The `updateLayerPreviews()` modification was well-intentioned but insufficient for this specific issue
- The problem appears to be deeper in the data flow than initially hypothesized
- This suggests there may be something unique about how the fuzzy skin layer is processed vs other layers
- The issue is isolated to this specific layer, not a systemic problem with the preview system

## Files Modified

- `src/features/profiles/baseProfiles.ts` - Added fuzzy skin default settings
- `src/features/profiles/profileCompiler.ts` - Modified preview preservation logic  
- `src/features/ui/components/ProfileSummary.tsx` - Temporary debug logging
- `.llm/context.md` - Updated to reflect ongoing issue status

## Architecture Impact

**Positive**: The preview preservation logic is a good improvement that allows default layers to maintain their manually crafted previews.

**Neutral**: Base profile changes are necessary groundwork but don't solve the core issue.

**Negative**: None - no regressions introduced.

## Conclusion

This represents a solid debugging attempt with logical fixes, but the core issue remains unresolved. The changes made are valuable improvements to the codebase, but additional investigation is needed to identify why the fuzzy skin layer specifically is not displaying its changes in the Profile Summary.

The issue requires a different approach, likely involving deeper debugging of the specific data flow for this layer compared to the working layers.
