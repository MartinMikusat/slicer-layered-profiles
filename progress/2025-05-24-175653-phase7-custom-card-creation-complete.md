## üìÅ New Files Created

### Core Implementation
- `src/features/cards/CardBuilder.tsx` - Main card creation interface (315 lines)
- `src/features/cards/SettingPicker.tsx` - Profile setting browser (258 lines)
- `src/features/cards/customCardService.ts` - localStorage persistence service (203 lines)
- `src/features/cards/index.ts` - Feature exports

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Integrated CardBuilder with state management
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Updated to reflect Phase 7 completion
- `.llm/context.md` - Cleared for commit

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Complete Card Creation Workflow
- **Form Interface**: Professional modal with comprehensive validation
- **Setting Browser**: Hierarchical view of profile settings by section
- **Value Input**: Type validation and unit display for settings
- **Preview Generation**: Automatic JSON patch creation and preview
- **Persistence**: localStorage with versioning and error handling

### User Experience Features
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, modern interface following existing design patterns
- **Search Functionality**: Find settings quickly across all profile sections
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for user actions

### Technical Features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling throughout the system
- **Storage Management**: Efficient localStorage with version control
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing card management system

## üéØ User Capabilities Unlocked

Users can now:
1. **Create Custom Cards**: Build their own profile modifications from scratch
2. **Browse Settings**: Explore all available profile settings organized by category
3. **Modify Values**: Change setting values with proper type validation
4. **Manage Cards**: Custom cards persist between sessions and integrate with existing workflow
5. **Full Workflow**: Create ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Use in PrusaSlicer

## üß™ Technical Implementation Highlights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Feature-based organization**: Cards feature in `src/features/cards/`
- **Service pattern**: Separate service layer for localStorage operations
- **Hook integration**: Seamless integration with existing state management
- **Type definitions**: Extended existing type system for new functionality

### Integration Points
- **App State**: Custom cards added to main application state
- **Persistence**: Automatic saving/loading with existing project system
- **UI Components**: Reused existing UI components (Dialog, Button, Input, etc.)
- **Conflict Detection**: Custom cards work with existing conflict detection system

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript**: Zero TypeScript errors in implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- **User Validation**: Form validation prevents invalid card creation
- **Data Integrity**: localStorage versioning prevents data corruption

## üîó Integration with Existing Features

### Seamless Workflow
- Custom cards appear alongside demo cards in workspace
- Drag & drop reordering works identically
- Conflict detection includes custom card modifications
- Export system includes custom cards in INI output
- Project persistence includes custom cards in saved projects

### State Management
- Custom cards load automatically on app startup
- Cards save immediately when created
- Removal updates both app state and localStorage
- Undo/redo system works with custom cards

## üìä Development Stats

- **Time Investment**: ~3-4 hours implementation
- **Files Created**: 4 new files
- **Files Modified**: 3 existing files
- **Lines of Code**: ~800+ lines of new functionality
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0
