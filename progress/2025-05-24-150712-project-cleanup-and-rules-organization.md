# Progress Summary: Project Cleanup and Rules Organization

**Date**: 2025-05-24 15:07:12  
**Milestone**: Project structure cleanup and development workflow optimization

## Changes Summary

### New Files Created
- `.llm/context.md` - Development context tracking file
- `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` - Updated and properly located cursor rules

### Modified Files
- `.gitignore` - Added `.llm/` folder to keep context tracking local
- `.llm/context.md` - Cleared for clean slate after feature completion

### Deleted Files
- `.cursorrules` - Removed deprecated rules file location

## Key Features Implemented

### Context Tracking System
- Created `.llm/` folder for development context management
- Implemented workflow for maintaining development continuity across sessions
- Established pattern for clearing context before git commits

### Improved Development Rules
- **Granular Task Management**: Added requirement for specific task breakdowns ("Align the top buttons" level)
- **Clear Feature Completion**: Defined feature completion as when user requests git commit
- **Enhanced Context Content**: Specified inclusion of blockers, key decisions, active files, and next steps
- **Proper Rules Location**: Moved from deprecated `.cursorrules` to `.cursor/rules/main.mdc`

## What Users Can Now Do
- Benefit from improved development continuity through context tracking
- Experience more systematic and organized development approach
- Expect granular task breakdowns for complex requests
- Have clear control over feature completion boundaries

## Implementation Plan Progress
- ✅ Project structure cleanup completed
- ✅ Development workflow optimization completed
- Ready to proceed with core application development phases

## Next Steps
- Await next user request for application development
- Context tracking system is ready for use
- All development guidelines are clarified and properly documented

## Technical Notes
- Context file follows pattern: check → update → clear before commits
- Rules properly located in `.cursor/rules/` folder (not deprecated `.cursorrules`)
- `.llm/` folder excluded from git to keep context local only
