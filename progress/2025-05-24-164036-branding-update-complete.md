- ✅ Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- ✅ Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment

## Technical Details

## Next Steps

3. **Community Feedback**: Share updated branding with community
4. **Documentation**: All docs now reflect clearer branding

## Why This Matters

The original name "Slicer Layer Composer" was too abstract and didn't clearly communicate the tool's purpose. "Layered Profile Builder" immediately tells users:
- It's about building something (profiles)
- The key innovation is layers
- It's a builder/creation tool

This makes the MVP much more accessible to new users and clearly communicates the value proposition.
