# Progress Summary: Summary Export Feature Removal

**Date**: 2025-05-24 19:46:39  
**Milestone**: Code Cleanup - Removed Unnecessary Summary Export Feature  
**Status**: Ready for commit

## Summary of Changes

Successfully removed the Summary export feature that generated .md files from the application. This feature didn't align with the core use case of the tool and was identified as unnecessary clutter in the user interface.

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
- **`src/App.tsx`** - Removed Summary export button, handler function, and cleaned up imports
- **`src/features/onboarding/OnboardingTour.tsx`** - Removed tour step for the Summary export button

## Key Features Removed

### 1. **Summary Export Button**
- ✅ Removed the "Summary" button from the export actions group in the header
- ✅ Button was generating markdown files with profile change summaries
- ✅ Simplified export interface to focus on core INI export functionality

### 2. **Export Handler Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed `handleExportSummary` function that was triggering markdown file downloads
- ✅ Cleaned up `exportChangeSummaryAsFile` import that is no longer needed
- ✅ Preserved other FileText icon usage for empty state displays

### 3. **Tour System Update**
- ✅ Removed the export-summary tour step that highlighted the removed button
- ✅ Maintained tour flow continuity between Share and Export INI steps
- ✅ Tour now correctly guides users through the streamlined export process

## What Users Can Now Do

1. **Cleaner Export Interface**: Users now see a focused export section with just the essential "Export INI" button
2. **Streamlined Tour Experience**: The onboarding tour no longer includes confusing references to markdown export
3. **Simplified Workflow**: Clear path from profile building to PrusaSlicer-compatible INI export

## Implementation Plan Progress

- ✅ Code cleanup and unnecessary feature removal completed
- ✅ User interface streamlined for better focus on core functionality
- ✅ Tour system updated to reflect current UI state

## Next Steps

- Continue with core application development phases
- Focus on essential features that directly support the main use case
- Maintain clean, focused user experience

## Technical Notes

- Preserved all FileText icon usage for legitimate UI elements (empty states)
- Maintained clean import structure without unused dependencies
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Export functionality remains fully operational for INI files
