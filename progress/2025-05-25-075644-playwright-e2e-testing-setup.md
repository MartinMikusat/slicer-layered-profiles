- **Playwright Integration**: Latest browser automation with auto-waiting
- **Cross-Browser Ready**: Configured for Chromium (easily expandable)
- **Visual Debugging**: Screenshots, videos, and traces on failures
- **Interactive Mode**: UI for step-by-step test debugging

### Development Experience
- **Local Testing**: Headed mode for visual test development
- **Artifact Capture**: Automatic screenshots, videos, and network logs
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Real timing measurements with thresholds
- **CI Integration**: Manual-trigger workflow to avoid build interference

## 📊 Test Scripts Available

### NPM Commands
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Run headless E2E tests

4. **CI Integration**: Manual testing in GitHub Actions when ready

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Test Structure
```
tests/e2e/
├── setup.ts              # Browser management and utilities
├── user-workflow.test.ts  # Main user journey tests
├── performance.test.ts    # Performance benchmarks
└── README.md             # Complete documentation
```

### Configuration Files
- `playwright.config.ts` - Main Playwright configuration
- `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - CI workflow (manual only)

### Integration Points
- **Development Server**: Auto-starts during local testing
- **Build Validation**: Tests against production builds in CI
- **Artifact Storage**: Screenshots and videos captured automatically

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Current Targets
- **Page Load**: < 5 seconds
- **Profile Compilation**: < 2 seconds
- **Drag & Drop**: < 1 second
- **Multiple Cards**: < 5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB

### Monitoring Features
- Real-time performance measurement
- Memory usage tracking via Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Network request monitoring
- Browser metrics collection

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Browser Settings
- **Development**: Visible browser, slow motion, devtools
- **CI**: Headless mode, faster execution, artifact capture
- **Auto-waiting**: Intelligent element waiting reduces flaky tests

### Test Execution
- **Serial Mode**: Tests run one at a time to avoid conflicts
- **Retry Logic**: 2 retries in CI, immediate failure in development
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second test timeout, 5-second element timeout

## 🚨 CI Integration Status

### Current State: Manual Only
- **Automatic Runs**: Disabled to prevent build interference
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch
- **Performance Tests**: Temporarily disabled for stability

### When Ready to Enable
1. Uncomment push/pull_request triggers in workflow
2. Enable performance test job by removing `if: false`
3. Add to main CI pipeline for comprehensive testing

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Local Testing**: Use `npm run test:e2e:dev` to verify tests work
2. **Add Data Test IDs**: Add `data-testid` attributes to components as needed
3. **Refine Tests**: Adjust selectors and assertions based on actual app behavior

### Future Enhancements
1. **Component Testing**: Add individual component tests
2. **API Testing**: Include backend API testing in Playwright
3. **Mobile Testing**: Add mobile device configurations
4. **Visual Regression**: Add screenshot comparison testing

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### Technology Benefits
- **Playwright Advantages**: More reliable than Puppeteer, better debugging
- **Auto-waiting**: Reduces flaky tests significantly
- **Modern API**: Better developer experience and maintenance
- **Cross-browser**: Easy expansion to Firefox and Safari

### Safety Measures
- **CI Protection**: Tests won't interfere with builds
- **Local Development**: Full debugging capabilities available
- **Artifact Capture**: Complete test evidence for troubleshooting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Early detection of performance regressions
