# Feature-Based Project Reorganization

**Date**: 2025-05-24 15:24:06  
**Milestone**: Major project structure reorganization completed  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Changes Summary

Successfully reorganized the entire project from a traditional file-type structure to a modern feature-based architecture. This restructuring improves maintainability, scalability, and developer experience by grouping related functionality together rather than separating by file type.

## New Feature Structure

### Created Feature Modules
- **`src/features/profiles/`** - Base profile management, compilation, hooks
- **`src/features/layers/`** - Layer cards, drag/drop, card components  
- **`src/features/export/`** - INI export, change summaries, file downloads
- **`src/features/projects/`** - Project persistence, sharing, URL encoding
- **`src/features/ui/`** - Shared UI components and hooks
- **`src/features/onboarding/`** - Tours, demos, help content

### Each Feature Contains
- Clean `index.ts` exports for public API
- Feature-specific components, hooks, and utilities
- Proper import/export boundaries

## Files Moved and Reorganized

### Profiles Feature
- ✅ `data/baseProfiles.ts` → `features/profiles/baseProfiles.ts`
- ✅ `hooks/useProfileCompiler.ts` → `features/profiles/useProfileCompiler.ts`
- ✅ `utils/profileCompiler.ts` → `features/profiles/profileCompiler.ts`

### Layers Feature
- ✅ `data/demoCards.ts` → `features/layers/demoCards.ts`
- ✅ `components/Card.tsx` → `features/layers/Card.tsx`
- ✅ `components/SortableCardList.tsx` → `features/layers/SortableCardList.tsx`
- ✅ `components/CardSearch.tsx` → `features/layers/CardSearch.tsx`

### Export Feature
- ✅ `utils/iniExporter.ts` → `features/export/iniExporter.ts`
- ✅ `utils/changeSummary.ts` → `features/export/changeSummary.ts`
- ✅ `utils/__tests__/` → `features/export/__tests__/`

### Projects Feature
- ✅ `components/ProjectManager.tsx` → `features/projects/ProjectManager.tsx`
- ✅ `hooks/useProjectPersistence.ts` → `features/projects/useProjectPersistence.ts`
- ✅ `utils/projectPersistence.ts` → `features/projects/projectPersistence.ts`
- ✅ `utils/urlSharing.ts` → `features/projects/urlSharing.ts`

### UI Feature
- ✅ `components/LoadingStates.tsx` → `features/ui/components/LoadingStates.tsx`
- ✅ `components/ui/*` → `features/ui/components/*`
- ✅ `hooks/useUndoRedo.ts` → `features/ui/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`
- ✅ `hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` → `features/ui/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`

### Onboarding Feature
- ✅ `components/OnboardingTour.tsx` → `features/onboarding/OnboardingTour.tsx`

## Modified Files

### Core Application
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Updated imports to use new feature structure
- ✅ `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` - Updated with feature-based organization guidelines

### Feature Index Files (New)
- ✅ `src/features/profiles/index.ts` - Clean exports for profiles feature
- ✅ `src/features/layers/index.ts` - Clean exports for layers feature
- ✅ `src/features/export/index.ts` - Clean exports for export feature
- ✅ `src/features/projects/index.ts` - Clean exports for projects feature
- ✅ `src/features/ui/index.ts` - Clean exports for UI feature
- ✅ `src/features/onboarding/index.ts` - Clean exports for onboarding feature

### Import Path Updates
- ✅ Fixed all relative import paths throughout the codebase
- ✅ Updated component-to-component imports
- ✅ Fixed lib/utils import paths for UI components
- ✅ Updated type imports to use correct relative paths

## Key Features Implemented

### Clean Feature APIs
- Each feature exports a clean public API through its index file
- Example: `import { Card, demoCards } from './features/layers'`
- Encapsulation while maintaining easy access to functionality

### Cross-Feature Communication
- Proper import patterns established
- UI components accessible from all features
- Shared types and constants properly referenced

### Maintainable Structure
- Related functionality grouped together
- Easy navigation and discovery
- Scalable for future feature additions

## User Capabilities

Users can now:
- ✅ **Development**: Easier codebase navigation with logical feature grouping
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Simpler debugging with feature-contained code
- ✅ **Scaling**: Clean addition of new features without cluttering
- ✅ **Onboarding**: Clear understanding of application architecture

## Technical Validation

### Build System
- ✅ `npm run build` - Successful production build
- ✅ `npm run dev` - Development server starts correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ All import paths resolve correctly

### Code Quality
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Proper TypeScript type resolution
- ✅ Clean feature boundaries maintained
- ✅ Public APIs well-defined

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Development**: New features should follow the established pattern
2. **Documentation**: Consider adding feature-specific README files
3. **Testing**: Update test imports if needed
4. **CI/CD**: Verify build pipeline works with new structure

## Implementation Plan Progress

**Phase 1: Core Architecture** - ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Feature-based reorganization provides solid foundation
- Clean import/export patterns established
- Scalable architecture in place

This reorganization significantly improves the project's maintainability and sets up a solid foundation for continued development. The feature-based structure aligns with modern React/TypeScript best practices and will scale well as the application grows.
