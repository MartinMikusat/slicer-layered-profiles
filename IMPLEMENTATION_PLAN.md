- [x] Add real-time profile preview

## Phase 3: User Interface (3-4 hours)

### âœ… 3.1 Card Components
- [x] Build draggable card component
- [x] Add card metadata display
- [x] Implement enable/disable toggle
- [x] Show setting changes preview

### âœ… 3.2 Drag & Drop System
- [x] Implement card reordering with @dnd-kit
- [x] Add visual feedback during drag
- [x] Update card order state
- [x] Handle drop zones and validation

### âœ… 3.3 Conflict Visualization
- [x] Detect setting conflicts between cards
- [x] Show conflict indicators on cards
- [x] Add tooltips explaining conflicts
- [x] Highlight overridden settings

## Phase 4: Core Functionality âœ… (2-3 hours)

### âœ… 4.1 INI Export System
- [x] Convert final JSON profile to INI format
- [x] Validate INI structure
- [x] Implement file download
- [x] Add export metadata/comments

### âœ… 4.2 Project Persistence
- [x] Save/load project state to localStorage
- [x] Export project as JSON file
- [x] Import project from JSON file
- [x] Handle migration/versioning

### âœ… 4.3 Demo & Sample Data
- [x] Create 3-5 demo cards (temperature, speed, quality)
- [x] Add "Load Demo" button
- [x] Pre-populate with working example
- [x] Add tooltips explaining each demo card

## Phase 5: Polish & Testing âœ… (2-3 hours)

### âœ… 5.1 User Experience Improvements
- [x] Add undo/redo functionality
- [x] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

### âœ… 5.2 Advanced Features
- [x] URL-based project sharing (base64 encoding)
- [x] Basic onboarding tour
- [x] Auto-generate change summary for RFC
- [x] Add card search/filtering

### ðŸ”² 5.3 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for core utilities
- [ ] Test with real PrusaSlicer profiles
- [ ] E2E test for main user flow
- [ ] Performance testing with many cards

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment (1 hour)

### ðŸ”² 6.1 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with usage instructions
- [ ] Document card creation format
- [ ] Add FAQ and troubleshooting
- [ ] Create RFC-ready summary

### ðŸ”² 6.2 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Build production version
- [ ] Test deployment locally
- [ ] Prepare GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Create release checklist

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)
- âœ… Base profile selection
- âœ… Card system with JSON patches
- âœ… Drag & drop card ordering
- âœ… Conflict detection and last-write-wins
- âœ… INI file export
- âœ… Local project save/load
- âœ… 3+ working demo cards

### Should Have (Polish)
- âœ… Undo/redo functionality
- âœ… Setting change previews
- âœ… Basic conflict visualization
- âœ… Mobile-friendly design
- âœ… Error handling

### Could Have (Advanced)
- âœ… URL sharing
- âœ… Onboarding tour
- âœ… RFC markdown export
- âœ… Card metadata and versioning

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage (no Redux needed)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit (better accessibility than react-dnd)
- **Patch System**: fast-json-patch (RFC 6901/6902 compliant)
- **File Format**: Standard PrusaSlicer INI

### Data Flow
```
Base Profile â†’ Apply Cards (ordered) â†’ Detect Conflicts â†’ Export INI
     â†“                â†“                      â†“
   JSON             Patches               Final JSON â†’ INI
```

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce profile compilation (500ms)
- Memo-ize card components
- Lazy load demo data
- Optimize drag operations

## Risk Mitigation

### Time Management
- Focus on core flow first
- Cut features aggressively if behind
- Test early and often
- Keep scope minimal but functional

### Technical Risks
- INI parsing edge cases â†’ Start with simple test cases
- Complex nested settings â†’ Document limitations clearly
- Browser compatibility â†’ Target modern browsers only
- Performance with many cards â†’ Test with 20+ cards

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1.2** - Set up types and basic structure
2. **Create sample data** - Real PrusaSlicer profile snippets
3. **Build incrementally** - Test each phase before moving on
4. **Document as you go** - Capture decisions and gotchas

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good**. Ship a working MVP that demonstrates the concept clearly.
