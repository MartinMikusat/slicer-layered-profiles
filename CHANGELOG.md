### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release - MVP Complete

This is the first release of the Slicer Layer Composer, a browser-based tool for composing PrusaSlicer profiles from modular "cards".

### Added

#### Core Functionality
- **Base Profile System**: Load and select from pre-configured MK4 profiles (Quality, Speed, Draft)
- **Card System**: Modular profile modifications using JSON Patch operations
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Intuitive card ordering with visual feedback
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and resolution of overlapping settings
- **INI Export**: Generate standard PrusaSlicer-compatible INI files
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of final setting values

#### User Experience
- **Demo Mode**: 5 example cards showcasing core functionality
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality on mobile devices
- **Undo/Redo**: Complete undo/redo support for all operations
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user shortcuts for common actions
- **Onboarding Tour**: Guided introduction for new users
- **Project Persistence**: Automatic save/load to browser localStorage

#### Advanced Features
- **URL Sharing**: Share projects via base64-encoded URLs
- **Project Import/Export**: Full project backup and restore
- **Change Summary**: Auto-generated markdown summaries for documentation
- **Card Search/Filtering**: Find cards by name, description, or tags
- **Conflict Visualization**: Clear indicators when cards override each other

#### Demo Cards Included
1. **Faster Perimeters** - Speed optimization for external walls
2. **Higher Temperature** - Better layer adhesion for problematic filaments
3. **Aggressive Cooling** - Improved overhangs and bridging performance
4. **Dense Infill** - Stronger parts with increased infill density
5. **Fine Quality** - Higher resolution printing with reduced layer heights

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Patch System**: fast-json-patch (RFC 6902 compliant)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit with accessibility support
- **State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- **Build System**: Vite with TypeScript strict mode

#### Browser Support
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

#### Performance
- Bundle size: ~294KB JavaScript (92KB gzipped)
- CSS size: ~16KB (3.7KB gzipped)
- Optimized for up to 50 cards
- 500ms debouncing for expensive operations

### Documentation

#### User Documentation
- Complete README with installation and usage instructions
- Card creation format documentation with examples
- FAQ and troubleshooting guide
- Browser compatibility information

#### Developer Documentation
- TypeScript type definitions for all interfaces
- Component architecture guidelines
- JSON Patch operation examples
- Contributing guidelines and cursor rules

#### Community Materials
- RFC summary for PrusaSlicer community
- Demo workflow documentation
- Troubleshooting and support guides

### Development Process

#### Completed Phases
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Core architecture setup (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Profile system (base profiles, cards, patches, conflicts)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: User interface (drag & drop, cards, conflict visualization)
- âœ… **Phase 4**: Core functionality (INI export, persistence, demo data)
- âœ… **Phase 5**: Polish & testing (undo/redo, shortcuts, mobile, error handling)
- âœ… **Phase 6**: Documentation & deployment (README, FAQ, GitHub Actions)

#### Quality Assurance
- TypeScript strict mode with zero errors
- ESLint configuration with no warnings
- Comprehensive error handling
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser compatibility verification

### Known Limitations

- **Profile Coverage**: Currently supports basic MK4 profiles only
- **Setting Scope**: Covers common settings, not all advanced PrusaSlicer features
- **Storage**: Local browser storage only (no cloud synchronization)
- **Import Validation**: Limited validation of imported profile structure
- **Performance**: May slow down with 50+ cards

### Future Roadmap

#### Potential Enhancements
- **Profile Import**: Load user's existing INI files as base profiles
- **Card Library**: Community repository for sharing cards
- **Advanced Settings**: Support for more complex PrusaSlicer features
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud storage for projects
- **Batch Operations**: Apply same cards to multiple profiles
- **Visual Card Editor**: GUI for creating cards without JSON

#### Community Features
- **Card Marketplace**: Curated collection of community cards
- **Profile Templates**: Pre-built profile combinations for specific use cases
- **Integration**: Potential PrusaSlicer plugin integration
- **Advanced Validation**: Setting compatibility checking
